This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common programming error: division by zero. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that includes error handling to prevent the ZeroDivisionError.  The error occurs when the function `my_function` is called with the argument 0, causing the program to crash.  The solution adds an `if` condition to check if the input value is 0 before attempting the division.
